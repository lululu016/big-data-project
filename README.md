# big-data-project

## Introduction
This project deploys MNIST application into the container. Users submit digital pictures with handwritten characters through curl-XPOST command. This program first recognizes the pictures, and then returns the recognized numbers to users. Every time a user submits an image, identifies a text and timestamp information in MNIST, it is recorded in Cassandra for storage.

## Demo
usingWeb.mp4 and usingCurl.mp4 is demos of this project.
